# Maine Go Site

The website for Maine Go.

## Stack

This site uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Email / Contact form

The contact form is powered by [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).

Setting up a Postmark account takes some extra time because your account
has to be approved by Postmark. If you really need to test sending emails,
reach out to Aaron and he can hook you up with a temporary API key.

Once you have an api key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project
with the following variables:

```
POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-api-key
CONTACT_FORM_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your-email-address
```

Now sending emails should work.

## Astro info

Everything below was generated by the Astro CLI.

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
