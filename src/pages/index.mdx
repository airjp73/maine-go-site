## News and Information for Maine Go Players

The goal of Maine Go is to promote the game of Go (Weiqi, Baduk) in
Maine. If you play go or would like to learn, come to any of our meetups!

We mostly talk and plan [on Discord](https://discord.gg/ej7GSFc).
When we play online, we usually play [on OGS where we have a group](https://online-go.com/group/832).

## Clubs & Events

[The third Maine State Championship and Open is September 21st, 2025.](/2025tournament)

### [Calendar](/events)

The best way to know what we're doing is to join us on Discord and ask us,
but this website should also be accurate.

We're meeting fairly regularly on Sundays in the cafe
inside the [**Portland Museum of Art**](https://www.portlandmuseum.org/magazine/cafe)
at 11am
(You don't need to buy a pass for the museum, just come downstairs),  
and Thursdays at 6pm at
the [Augusta Panera Bread](https://www.panerabread.com/content/panerabread_com/en-us/cafe/locations/me/augusta/37-xavier-loop).

## AGA

Maine Go is an [American Go Association (AGA)](https://www.usgo.org/) chapter.
If you are not a member, consider joining the AGA.
The AGA provides support and ranking for its chapters and members.
If you are interested in joining the AGA, you can join through Maine Go and get half off your first year membership!
