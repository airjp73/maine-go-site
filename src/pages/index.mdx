## News and Information for Maine Go Players

The goal of Maine Go is to promote the game of Go (Weiqi, Baduk) in
Maine. If you play go or would like to learn, come to any of our meetups!

We mostly talk and plan [on Discord](https://discord.gg/ej7GSFc).
When we play online, we usually play [on OGS where we have a group](https://online-go.com/group/832).

## Clubs

#### Portland

We meet most Sundays from 11am to 2pm in the cafe
inside the [Portland Museum of Art](https://www.portlandmuseum.org/magazine/cafe).
(You don't need to buy a pass for the museum, just come downstairs!)

#### Augusta

We meet most Thursdays at 6pm at
the [Augusta Panera Bread](https://www.panerabread.com/content/panerabread_com/en-us/cafe/locations/me/augusta/37-xavier-loop).

#### Online

Most of us have [OGS](https://online-go.com) accounts.
Sometimes, particularly on Wednesdays, we'll convene to play games there, and use Discord for audio.

## Events
